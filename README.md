# EK-MaxFlowExperiement
Assignment on Maximum Flow Problem - Advanced Algorithms Course (UFRGS) 

# TODO:
- [ ] Count the number of operations in BFS.
- [ ] Count the number of augmentations.
- [ ] Count the total number of operations, divide by its theoretical bound O(nm**2)
- [ ] Count the number of times a single edge is saturated.
- [ ] Create a Bash script to run operations experiments.
- [ ] Develop a Python script for plotting experiments.

# Assignment 
## Deadline: May 1, 2024.

#### Objectives:
- Implement the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the maximum s-t flow.
- Experimentally verify the algorithm's complexity.

#### Test Cases:
- A test case generator in DIMACS format in C is available [here](https://github.com/mrpritt/Fluxo_Maximo).

#### Conventions:
- Algorithm implementations should accept an instance in DIMACS format on standard input (stdin) and print the value of the maximum flow on standard output (stdout).

#### Test Case Generator:
- The maxflow.cpp code calculates the maximum flow. To compile: use C++ and Boost.
