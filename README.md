- [x] Count the number of times a single edge is saturated.
- [x] Create a Bash script to run operations experiments.
- [x] Python Notebook for plotting experiments.
- [x] Compute the path size over each augmentation.
- [x] Count the number of times each edge is a critical edge 

# Assignment 
## Deadline: May 1, 2024.

#### Objectives:
- Implement the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the maximum s-t flow.
- Experimentally verify the algorithm's complexity.

#### Test Cases:
- A test case generator in DIMACS format in C is available [here](https://github.com/mrpritt/Fluxo_Maximo).

#### Conventions:
- Algorithm implementations should accept an instance in DIMACS format on standard input (stdin) and print the value of the maximum flow on standard output (stdout).

#### Test Case Generator:
- The maxflow.cpp code calculates the maximum flow. To compile: use C++ and Boost.
